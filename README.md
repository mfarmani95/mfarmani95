### About
I study land-surface hydrology and ecohydrology with a focus on soil–vegetation–atmosphere interactions, baseflow generation, and precipitation-forcing impacts on snow and streamflow. My work spans Noah-MP & RAPID modeling, SWE/LAI evaluation, and gauge-sampled vs. gridded precipitation analysis (AORC, NLDAS2, CONUS404, IMERG).

### Research interests
- Soil moisture memory & key soil hydrological processes  
- Baseflow generation mechanisms in arid/semi-arid basins  
- Precipitation product evaluation and downscaling  
- Physics–ML hybrid modeling for hydrology
